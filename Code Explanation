                  HTML (index.html)
The HTML document defines the structure of the investment calculator.
It includes input fields for initial investment, annual interest rate, and the number of years for investment.
It has a button to trigger the calculation and a container to display the result.

Styles the layout of the calculator.
Defines the appearance of the input fields, button, and result container.

                  JavaScript (index.js)
The JavaScript code is responsible for calculating the investment.
It waits for the HTML content to be fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded event).
It gets references to the necessary HTML elements (button and result container).
It adds an event listener to the calculate button.
When the button is clicked, it retrieves the values entered by the user (initial investment, interest rate, and investment years).
It then calculates the total amount after the specified number of years using the formula for compound interest.
Finally, it updates the result container with the calculated total amount.
In summary, this code creates a simple investment calculator that calculates the future value of an investment based on the initial investment amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years the investment will be held.
